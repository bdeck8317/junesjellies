# Remembering June Deck

My grandmother, June, was one of the hardest working and thoughtful person I have ever encountered. She put love and effort into everything she made, and it always seemed that her recipes tasted best.




4 cups of prepared pears (about 3 pounds of ripe fruit)

¼ cup water

¼ cup lemon juice

7 ½ cups (3 ¼ pounds) sugar

1 teaspoon cinnamon

1 teaspoon cloves

1 teaspoon allspice

1 box Sure Jell pectin, 1.75 oz.

Peel, core and chop very fine, 3 pounds of ripe pears. Add chopped pears, water and lemon juice into saucepan. Cook until fruit is soft. Use a food mill or potato masher to mash the cooked fruit. Place 4 cups of the prepared fruit & juice mixture into a large saucepan. Add the Sure Jell pectin and bring to a full rolling boil. Add the exact amount of sugar and the cinnamon, cloves and allspice into the saucepan and mix well. Bring the mixture back to a full rolling boil, stirring constantly. Boil hard for 1 minute, stirring constantly to minimize foaming. Ladle preserves into jars and seal.

Yields 8-9, 8 ounce jars of preserves.
